# CardGame904
Used to host a server that plays the card game 904. Contains functions that are to be called from a web page.

April 7, 2020 - Created the repo. Decided to write the 904 backend using Python + Flask.
              - Hello world + Some basic skeletal classes

April 8, 2020 - Fixed the functions, created proper JSON response for 'newgame'. Verified from front-end. 
April 9, 2020 - Added some more fields to JSON with a bunch of new DataModel classes. Added dummy method 'alter_move'
April 12, 2020 - Coded 'alter_move'. Doing a premature check-in (without testing/verifying) for Krithika
                to look into the CORS issue.
