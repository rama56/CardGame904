# CardGame904
Used to host a server that plays the card game 904. Contains functions that are to be called from a web page.

April 7, 2020 - Created the repo. Decided to write the 904 backend using Python + Flask.
              - Hello world + Some basic skeletal classes

April 8, 2020 - Fixed the functions, created proper JSON response for 'newgame'. Verified from front-end.
